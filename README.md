### 🔍 About Me

I’m a hands-on **Software Engineering Leader** with over a decade of experience across startups, automotive, and heavy machinery sectors. My background spans full-cycle product development, software quality assurance, and managing the delivery of **safety-critical embedded systems**.

At John Deere, I lead cross-functional teams building agricultural embedded systems for tractors, sprayers, and planters. I’m passionate about building systems that matter, growing high-performing teams, and bridging the gap between leadership and deep technical work.

I also actively build tools to improve engineering workflows — like Ellygent, a modern AI assistant for writing and managing requirements.

**Key Strengths:**
